            <p>I've been doing something with technology since the late 70s. From the start I was hungry to know more. Tech was my drug. And not having the greatest of a family life, I sank deep into the geek life. Though I went straight into hacker life which was really really fun in the beginning, then a hard lesson in "don't do that, son" changed things in life for a while. After all of that, I went into support and services with 2 really long-term temp. contracts with  Weyerhaeuser and (what is now) Russell Investments.</p>

            <p>Eventually I had the itch to go out on my own and in the early 90s I started my first business, which was a tech support and service shop. We did the retail thing, had a in-store service shop, did classes for basic use, were part of the domain registrar and hosting business for a while, and created websites for clients.</p>

            <p>Then around 2001 I helped some friends move from Seattle to Cooperstown, NY. And I just never left! I was brought on by SUNY to manage their computer labs and such as well as create "online exhibits" for the NYS Historical Association.</p>

            <p>In 2004, I started my third IT service (all onsite service) business which only just closed its doors in 2020 due to you know what.</p>

            <p>I wanted to do something different and thought web development would be a good fit.</p>
